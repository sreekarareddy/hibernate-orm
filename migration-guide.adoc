This guide discusses migration to Hibernate ORM version 6.4. For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

[[soft-delete]]
== Soft Delete

6.4 adds support for soft deletes, using the new `@SoftDelete` annotation.
See the link:{userGuideBase}#soft-delete[User Guide] for details.

In previous versions, support for soft-deletes was somewhat implementable using
a combination of any or all of event-listeners, filters, `@Where`, etc.
Applications using such implementations are encouraged to switch.


[[custom-tenant-identifier-type]]
== Custom tenant identifier type

The `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver` and `MultiTenantConnectionProvider` SPIs were generified to support custom tenant identifier types.
Both types now accept a type parameter that represents the tenant identifier type.
Methods that were accepting or returning a tenant identifier value of type `String` were changed to use the type variable.

Applications can migrate by specifying the type parameter `<String>` when extending `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver`
or one of the `MultiTenantConnectionProvider` subtypes.


[[IdGeneratorStrategyInterpreter]]
== Removed IdGeneratorStrategyInterpreter

`IdGeneratorStrategyInterpreter` has been deprecated since 6.0 and has been removed to simplify id generator internals.

[[function-rendering-support-deprecation]]
== Deprecation of `FunctionRenderingSupport`

The `FunctionRenderingSupport` interface was deprecated for removal in favor of the new `FunctionRenderer` interface.
`FunctionRenderer` extends `FunctionRenderingSupport`, so switching to the new type should not be a big deal.
Classes the previously implemented the `FunctionRenderingSupport` interface should switch to implement `FunctionRenderer`
and the signature of the implemented `render(SqlAppender, List, SqlAstTranslator)` method has to be changed to
`render(SqlAppender, List, ReturnableType, SqlAstTranslator)` i.e. add `ReturnableType` as second last argument.

The newly passed `ReturnableType` argument allows the rendering process to consider the resolved function result type
during rendering, which is common for certain array specific functions, especially for Oracle.

Note that the deprecation also affects some methods/constructors of the `SelfRenderingSqlAstExpression` type hierarchy,
which were previously accepting/returning a `FunctionRenderingSupport`. Constructors that accept a `FunctionRenderer`
have been added to:

* `SelfRenderingSqmFunction`
* `SelfRenderingSqmWindowFunction`
* `SelfRenderingSqmAggregateFunction`
* `SelfRenderingSqmOrderedSetAggregateFunction`
* `SelfRenderingFunctionSqlAstExpression`
* `SelfRenderingWindowFunctionSqlAstExpression`
* `SelfRenderingAggregateFunctionSqlAstExpression`
* `SelfRenderingOrderedSetAggregateFunctionSqlAstExpression`

In addition, the `SelfRenderingSqmFunction.getRenderingSupport()` method was deprecated in favor of the new `SelfRenderingSqmFunction.getFunctionRenderer()` method.
Finally, the `SelfRenderingFunctionSqlAstExpression.getRenderer()` method was deprecated in favor of the new `SelfRenderingFunctionSqlAstExpression.getFunctionRenderer()` method.


[[SupportedDialects]]
== Supported Dialects

Please also do have a look at the link:{versionDocBase}/dialect/dialect.html[Supported Dialects] document to check for potential upgrades to the minimum version of the databases underpinning the dialects that Hibernate currently supports.
